# Products Overview

Liferay Commerce provides three out-of-the-box Product types: [Simple](./creating-a-simple-product.md), [Grouped](./creating-a-grouped-product.md), and [Virtual](./creating-a-virtual-product.md). Each Product type is stored in a [Catalog](../../catalogs/creating-a-new-catalog.md) and assigned a default [SKU](./adding-skus-to-your-products.md) at creation. <!--By default, Products are visible to all Channels and , but you can control Product visibility, determining which Channels or Accounts can view a Product.-->
