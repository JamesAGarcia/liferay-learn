# Applying Tax Rates

Once you've [set tax rates](./setting-rates-for-tax-calculations.md) to a Tax Category, you can apply them to products and shipping costs by assigning the Tax Category to them. When assigned, all of the Category's applicable tax rates are calculated and added to the order's total.

```note::
   When a category is assigned to a product or shipping cost, all applicable rates are used to calculate the total taxes for the order. This includes rates created using the same or different tax engines.
```
