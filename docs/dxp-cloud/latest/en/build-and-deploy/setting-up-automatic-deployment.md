# Setting Up Automatic Deployment

With DXP Cloud, you can use webhooks to automatically trigger Jenkins builds for changes made to your project's Git repository (e.g., [GitHub](../getting-started/configuring-your-github-repository.md#integrating-with-the-jenkins-service), [Bitbucket](../getting-started/configuring-your-bitbucket-repository.md#connecting-bitbucket-to-your-jenkins-service), [GitLab](../getting-started/configuring-your-gitlab-repository.md#connecting-gitlab-to-your-jenkins-service)). These builds can then be manually deployed to project environments via the DXP Cloud Console. Alternatively, you can speed up the deployment process by configuring the CI service to automatically deploy successful builds from a specific branch to your `dev` environment.

Follow these steps to set up automatic deployment:

1. Navigate to the `infra` environment for your DXP Cloud Project.

1. Go to the *CI* service's page, and click on the *Environment Variables* tab.

1. Add the following variable to the CI service:

   * **Key**: `DEVELOPMENT_BRANCH_NAME`

   * **Value**: enter the name of the branch you want to use for automatic deployments.

1. Click on *Save Changes*. This causes the CI service to restart with the new variable.

Once restarted, any changes merged to your specified branch are automatically built and deployed to the `dev` environment if successful.
