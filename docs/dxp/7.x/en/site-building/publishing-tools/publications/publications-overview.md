# Publications Overview

DXP's *Publications* tool... you and your teams can develop, track, and publish changes to your DXP instance. With it, your team can work concurrently on the same or different publications to group changes into publishable blocks. <!--Use each publication to make and review changes to your DXP instance before they go live.-->

## How Does It Work?

Publications creates a database column to indicate which version of the content is displayed on Production.

Fundamental Idea: Users can create separate 'publications', individual __, where changes can they can develop and preview their changes before they go live. When you publish a publication, only the changes included in the individual publication are made live in Production. This concept allows a publication to be as fine-grained as fixing typos to as large as a complete site redesign to happen independent from other changes. You can have as many change lists as you require and they can all be published on their own schedule.

Two modes: publication edit mode and a Production mode. The content behavior might change depending on which mode you're browsing.
