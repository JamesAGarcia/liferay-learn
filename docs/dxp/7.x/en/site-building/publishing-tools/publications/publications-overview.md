# Publications Overview

The *Publications* tool provides a convenient and flexible way for you and your teams to develop, track, and publish changes to your DXP instance. With it, your team can work concurrently on different publications that group changes into blocks that can be published together when ready. <!--Use each publication to make and review changes to your DXP instance before they go live.-->

Team members can work on their own timelines, creating and collaborating on as many publications as they need. Users can work concurrently and create as many publications as needed to group, track, and rollout their changes.

## How Does It Work?

Publications creates a database column to indicate which version of the content is displayed on Production.

Fundamental Idea: Users can create separate 'publications', individual __, where changes can they can develop and preview their changes before they go live. When you publish a publication, only the changes included in the individual publication are made live in Production. This concept allows a publication to be as fine-grained as fixing typos to as large as a complete site redesign to happen independent from other changes. You can have as many change lists as you require and they can all be published on their own schedule.

Two modes: publication edit mode and a Production mode. The content behavior might change depending on which mode you're browsing.
